This sample shows how DFP ad impressions can be recorded manually when an ad
sits inside a UIScrollView. The sample waits for the ad to be returned and
to be on screen to record an impression, and only records 1 impression per
request.

This sample was written and tested with Google Admob SDK v6.4.2, and
supports iOS 5.0 and higher.

Requirements:
- Xcode 4.2 or higher
- iOS SDK 5.0 or higher
- Google AdMob Ads SDK for iOS 6.4 or higher
- AdMob publisher ID
