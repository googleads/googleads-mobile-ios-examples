# iOS Rewarded Interstitial Ad Example

This is a minimal example showing how to use rewarded interstitial ads in an iOS
application. This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google Mobile Ads
SDK, but is compatible with CocoaPods and includes a Podfile.

## Replace Your Ad Unit ID

This example comes with a preconfigured ad unit ID. You should create an ad unit
ID after signing in to https://admob.google.com and use that ad unit ID in your
own apps.
