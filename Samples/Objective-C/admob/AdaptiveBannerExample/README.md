# iOS Adaptive Banner Example

This is a minimal example showing how to place an adaptive banner ad into an iOS
application.

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google Mobile Ads SDK, but is
compatible with Cocoapods and includes a Podfile. We recommend using Cocoapods
to reference the SDK. You can do this by running:

`pod update`

If you don't have Cocoapods installed, visit
https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3 to get started.

After running pod update, Cocoapods creates a .xcworkspace that you can open and
run.

## Replace Your Ad Unit ID

This example comes with a preconfigured ad unit ID. You should create an ad unit
ID on http://apps.admob.com and use that ad unit ID in your own apps.
