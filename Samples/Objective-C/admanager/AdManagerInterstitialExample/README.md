# iOS Ad Manager Interstitial Example

This is a minimal example showing how to place an Ad Manager interstitial ad
into an iOS application.

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google Mobile Ads SDK, but is
compatible with Cocoapods and includes a Podfile. We recommend using Cocoapods
to reference the SDK. You can do this by running:

`pod update`

If you don't have Cocoapods installed, visit
https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html#toc_3 to get started.

After running pod update, Cocoapods creates a .xcworkspace that you can open and
run.

## Replace the Ad Unit ID

This example comes with a preconfigured Ad Manager ad unit ID. You should create
your own inventory in Ad Manager and reference your own ad unit ID.
